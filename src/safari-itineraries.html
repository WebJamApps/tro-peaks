            off your feet, lie back and wait for the sun to set over the lake and on Oldonyo Lengai.</p>
          <p><span class="w3-text-indigo">Day 7:</span>Full day in Lake Natron Waterfalls<br />
            A well deserved relaxing day at the the cascading waterfalls and cool off in the small pool at their base. Your only

            stories and legends about his &lsquo;Mountain of God&rsquo; as you climb the steep slopes of this still-active volcano to
            greet the sunrise at eleven thousand feet above the surrounding plains. Gaze in awe at the bubbling lava and steaming
            geysers of Lengai&rsquo;s crater and watch the sun rise on Kilimanjaro, 250 km away. Make your way down to the base before
            this same sun hits the treeless slopes and drive back to camp for lunch and a free afternoon at your private Lake Natron
            Camp.</p>

          <h3>6 Days Walking Safari in Ngorongoro Highlands</h3>
          <p>The Crater Highlands consist of an elevated range of volcanoes and collapsed volcanoes, which rise from the side of the
            Great Rift Valley and run along the Eastern edge of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The peaks include Oldeani, Lemagrut,
            Olmoti, Loolmalasin, Empakaai, Ngorongoro and the active Ol Doinyo Lengai. They all have a number of impressive peaks - with
            steep escarpments, crater lakes, dense forests and grassy ridges, streams and waterfalls. The area is secluded and rarely
            visited but offers some of Tanzania&rsquo;s most jagged and extraordinary scenery and some of the finest trekking. Most
            walking is done at around the 3000m mark though there are more routes available to the more adventurous.</p>
          <p><span class="w3-text-indigo">Day 1</span> - Ngorongoro Crater<br />
            We depart Moshi town in the morning and drive via Lake Manyara National Park for lunch and some afternoon game viewing.
            The Lake Manyara National park is serene and beautiful with main attractions of a rich bird life, tree-climbing lions,its
            elephants, and hippos that you can see at closer range than most other places. Lake Manyara is an alkaline lake and at
            certain times of the year hosts thousands of flamingos and a diversity of other bird life. Although it is one of the
            smallest parks, its vegetation is so diverse enabling it to host a variety of wildlife habitats. <br />
            From there we proceed on to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Overnight at the Simba campsite on the crater rim.
            The Ngorongoro crater is the world&rsquo;s biggest intact volcanic caldera at 8300 sq km and is frequently described as one
            of the wonders of the world, not only because of its geological magnificence, but also because it serves as an
            extraordinary natural sanctuary for some of Africa&rsquo;s largest populations of large mammals. Ngorongoro and other
            freestanding mountains are volcanic in origin, geologists claim that this was formed during the fracturing process that
            created the Rift Valley 15 to 20 million years ago.</p>

          <p><span class="w3-text-indigo">Day 2</span> - Olmoti Crater<br />
            Departing the campsite after breakfast we drive up to Nainokanoka Masai Village on the slopes of Olmoti mountain where we
            pick-up the local guide/and ranger and start the ascent of Olmoti crater. Olmoti crater is a sunken caldera that can only be
            reached on foot and is about a 3-4 hours walk to the rim. From the rim you could walk to an appealing waterfall where the
            Munge River leaves the Olmoti crater. Water collecting in the crater flows down the falls and eventually runs into Lake Magadi
            in Ngorongoro Crater. We set camp back at Nainokanoka village close to the Masai bomas. </p>
          <p><span class="w3-text-indigo">Day 3</span> - Empakaai Crater<br />
            After breakfast we depart Nainokanoka village and follow Masai cattle trails northeast across the grasslands of the Embulbul
            depression, towards Empakaai Crater, reaching the lightly wooded crater rim on its southern edge, which normally takes 7 - 8
            hours. Almost half the floor of the 6km wide, 300m high Empakaai Crater is taken up by a deep soda lake. Blue monkey, buffalo,
            and bushbuck are likely to be seen on the rim, which boasts good views of Lengai Volcano, Mt. Kilimanjaro and Lake Natron.
            The crater floor is home to a variety of antelope and water birds. We set camp on the crater rim for the night.</p>
          <p><span class="w3-text-indigo">Day 4</span> - Empakaai Crater rim trek<br />
            A path circles the whole of the crater rim and we can follow this to reach a low point on the western rim, The views from
            here down into the crater are spectacular. The steep inner walls are densely forested and drop to the flat crater floor,
            which is partly submerged under a lake, often surrounded by huge flocks of flamingos. There is a good chance of seeing
            wildlife here as the Masai are generally not allowed to cattle graze. It is possible to descend into the crater itself and
            camp by the lake, although this means carrying the camping gear, as it is too steep for the donkeys. You will require
            extending your trip by one day if you wish to do this. Instead you may opt to camp on the rim for two nights and descend
            to the crater floor for the whole day.</p>
          <p><span class="w3-text-indigo">Day 5</span> - Nainokanoka Masai Village<br />
            After breakfast we return from Empakaai via the western trail and spend the night back at Nainokanoka village close to the
            Masai bomas.</p>
          <p><span class="w3-text-indigo">Day 6</span> - Ngorongoro crater tour - return to Moshi<br />
            After breakfast we descend into the Ngorongoro Crater with our vehicle for a half-day crater tour. Ngorongoro Crater is one of Africa&rsquo;s best-known wildlife viewing areas and one of Tanzania&rsquo;s most visited.
            Within its walls are a variety of animals and vegetation, including grasslands, swamps, forests, saltpans and a fresh water
            lake. You are likely to see lion, elephant, rhino, buffalo, and many of the plains herbivores such as wildebeest,
            Thomson&rsquo;s gazelle, zebra, reedbuck, as well as thousands of flamingos wading in the shallows of Lake Magadi &ndash;
            the soda lake at the craters base. After lunch we break camp and depart back to Moshi town where you will be dropped off at
            your hotel.</p>
