            &ldquo;As wide as all the world, great, high and unbelievably white in the sun was the square top of Mount
            Kilimanjaro,&rdquo; wrote Ernest Hemingway of the highest mountain in Africa, which rises to 5,895 meters above sea level.
            Situated near the town of Moshi in northern Tanzania, Mount Kilimanjaro rises from the dry plains, through a wide belt of
            forest and high alpine heath to an almost bare desert and finally the snow capped summit, Uhuru Peak, just 3 degrees
            south of the equator.
          </p>
          <p>One of the world&#39;s highest free standing mountains, Mt. Kilimanjaro is comprised of three extinct volcanoes: Kibo
            5895 m (19340 ft.), Mawenzi 5149 m (16896 ft.), and Shira 3962 m (13000 ft.).
          </p>
          <p> The name itself is shrouded in mystery. It might mean Mountain of Light, Mountain of Greatness or Mountain of Caravans.
            The local people, the Wachagga tribe, call the whole massif- &quot;Kilemakyaro&quot; meaning &quot;Our Mountain&quot; with
            its highest point only Kipoo (now known as Kilimanjaro and its highest point Kibo or Uhuru Peak) for the familiar snowy peak
            that stands imperious, as overseer of the continent and the summit of Africa.
          </p>
          <p>Kilimanjaro is one of the world&#39;s most accessible high summits, a beacon for visitors from around the world. Most
            climbers reach the crater rim with little more than a walking stick, proper clothing and determination. And those who reach
            Uhuru Point, the actual summit, or Gillman&#39;s Point on the lip of the crater, will have earned their climbing certificates
            and the accompanying memories.
          </p>
          <p>There are route options for the mountain. The biggest difference between the routes is that on Marangu Route, overnights are spent in
            dormatory style huts which are equipped with solar power. All other routes are camping routes. Marangu Route is also the only route where the descent follows the same path as the climb. Rongai route also descends using this route, making
            the traffic on this route much heavier than other routes. A climb can be done in as few as 5 days (Marangu Route) but the chance of success is not very high. The biggest obstacle during the climb is the lower oxygen content at higher
            altitudes. In fact, at the summit, the oxygen content is only half of that at sea-level. By spending more days during the climb, your body has a greater opportunity to adjust. After reading the information about the routes, if you have
            further questions, we are happy to help you.

          <p>Mount Meru is one of Africa&#39;s highest and most beautiful volcanoes. The route to the summit passes through parkland, montane forest, a
            giant heather zone and moorland. Finally, the summit is reached by a narrow,barren ridge which provides stunning views of the ash cone
            several thousand feet below. There are also great views of the nearby Mt. Kilimanjaro. This climb is used by many as a acclimitization for a
            Mt. Kilimanjaro climb but it is an excellent trek in its own right. It also requires fewer days to climb so those without enough time to climb
            Mt. Kilimanjaro may consider this option. In addition, it is proportionally less expensive than a Mt. Kilimanjaro climb.
          </p>
          <p>The mountain in located inside of Arusha National Park. Here, over 400 species of birds, rhino, elephant, buffalo, baboon, warthog, black and
            white Colobus monkey and duiker are all found in this delightful &ldquo;gem amonst parks.&rdquo; <br />
            The group will be accompanied on Mount Meru by a Tro-Peaks Adventure guide, a manditory park ranger and porters. On the mountain we use dormitory
            style huts. A sleeping bag and mat are required for the huts. The mountain has only one route to climb, the Momella route. This can be achieved in
            either three or four days. We also have a special itinerary for climbing both Mt. Meru and Mt. Kilimanjaro in 10 days. To view this option, see
            the Two Peaks itinerary in the Kilimanjaro routes.</p>

            This acitve volcano is a holy spot for the Maasai. In fact its name literally means 'Mountain of god' in the Maasai langauge. Maasai from both Tanzania and Kenya who practice their traditional religion come here to offer sacrifice to
            the god. The climb is void of shade and vegetation, making it a hot and dusty trek. The climbs start in the very early hours to avoid the scorching sun. The climb itself can be done in half a day, but it is most often combined with a
            longer trek. The two most popular itinerary options are outlined below but of course we can make alterations to fit your desires.
