          <h3>Coffee/Waterfall</h3>
          <p>Mt Kilimanjaro offers a variety of activities other than climbing to Uhuru Peak. The beauty and culture of the Kilimanjaro Region and its Chagga tribe
            presents a fascinating opportunity to experience the relationship between the mountain and its inhabitants. The waterfall &amp; coffee plantation tour offers
            such an opportunity. At the lower sloped of Kilimanjaro there are several picturesque waterfalls amid the rain-forest. You will get the opportunity to go for
            a walk down the steep banks to the waterfalls. The water is pure and safe for swimming and you can view the wide variety of birds and spot troops of monkeys
            supervising your trek from the tree branches. You will pass historical sites of clan wars and ancient legends including large caves that were used for
            hiding during the Chagga vs Maasai wars in both Marangu and Kibosho.</p>
          <p>
            You will have the chance to visit one of the many coffee and banana plantations and see how coffee is processed and brewed traditionally. This tour is
            not far from Moshi, so this trip is a good choice for anyone who had a free day before or after a Northern Circuit safari.</p>

          <h3>Lake Chala</h3>
          <p>Lake Chala is a unique caldera lake, and is thought to be the deepest inland body of water in Africa. This lake is fed by underground springs from Mt. Kilimanjaro.
            The lake has a great diversity of life. From lush lake shore forest to stunning volcanic savannah; from river beds marvelously carved through ancient rock, to
            thick bush or open &#39;mbuga&#39;. Walking at Lake Chala is a magical experience that will put you back in touch with nature.
            Chala has a huge variety of amazing trees, grasses and plants; some are unique to the area.
            According to the time of year there are hundreds of species of butterflies and birds, including spectacular birds of prey. The African Fish Eagle, with its
            haunting techniques, Verreaux&#39;s eagle, Augur buzzards and many other species of birds can be seen around the crater walls.
            Wild mammals do vary including blue monkeys, Colobus monkeys, baboons, dik-dik, kudu and elephant.
            Chala is an untouched part of a truly ancient land and a must visit place.</p>
          <p>Activities at this lake: walking safaris, canoeing, swimming and fishing.</p>

          <h3>Schools/Orphanages</h3>

          <p>Tro-Peaks will gladly accompany you on a trip to visit local schools and orphanages and help you learn about life in Tanzania and the educational system.
            The length of the trip can vary from 2 hours to a whole day, depending on your schedule and desire. Bringing small gifts (such as pencils or notebooks)
            is welcome but not required. Often this is best handled by giving the gifts to the teacher and allowing them to distribute the gifts. This also reduces the likelihood
            that children will beg any foreigner for a handout. You can choose from orphanages, nursery schools, primary schools, secondary schools, and even university and vocational training
            schools. If you have an interest in visiting any other institutions such as hospitals or churches, please contact us and we can easily make arrangements.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>Volunteering</h3>

          <p> Tro-Peaks Adventures is well connected to some organizations where you can donate your time and talents to helping the local community. This can be
            done from a time period of one day up to one year. Contact us so we can find the right match for your talents and time availability. Options include
            tree planting, teaching, medical assistance, fund-raising and personal care. We guarantee that it will be a memorable experience and you will get a
            chance to see the country from a much different perspective than a normal tourist. If you have the desire to help but not the time, we can accept
            donations on your behalf and forward 100% of them to organizations that we are confident that are well run. Other donations that are valuable
            include laptop/tablet computers, sports equipment (do not send clothing by mail as the duty to be paid is quite high). </p>
