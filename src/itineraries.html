            <h3>Rongai Route 6 Days or 7 Days</h3>
            <p>
              This is one of Kilimanjaro’s easiest routes, and it has become an increasingly popular route in recent years. This route is located on the northern side of Mount Kilimanjaro with a variety of spectacular landscapes together with
              different plants and animals species. The typical duration for this trip is 6 days. However, you can also add an acclimatization day and make it 7 day climb.
              The Rongai Route is more scenic than the Marangu Route and easier than other camping route in climbing Kilimanjaro and the success rate on the Rongai Route is very high. Unlike the Marangu Route where you sleep in huts, on the Rongai
              Route you sleep in tents, the porter will have your tent pitched and waiting for you at the end of each days trek. This route starts on the north side of the mountain just south of the Kenyan border and is one of the least traveled
              routes. The route merges with the Marangu Route for the summit climb. The descend follows the Marangu Route on the mountain’s southeast side, so you will able see Kilimanjaro from many view points. There are two versions of this trek
              –
              a direct 6-day itinerary, and a 7-day itinerary that takes a longer route. The 6-day itinerary is described down below and the longer variation is described in the extra day’s section.

              through
              the rain forest to Shira 1 Camp, the Shira route bypasses this segment by using a vehicle to transport climbers to Shira Gate, located near the Shira Ridge.
              On the first day on the mountain, climbers begin their hike from (3,400 m) and end at Shira One Campsite, (3,5OO m). The remainder of the route is follows the southern circuit route, traversing beneath the Southern icefields before
              summitting from Barafu or Western Breach Route.
