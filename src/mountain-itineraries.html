            <h3>Kilimanjaro Rongai Route 6 Days or 7 Days</h3>
            <p>
              This is one of Kilimanjaroâ€™s easiest routes, and it has become an increasingly popular route in recent years. This route is located on the northern side of Mount Kilimanjaro with a variety of spectacular landscapes together with
              different plants and animals species. The typical duration for this trip is 6 days. However, you can also add an acclimatization day and make it 7 day climb.
              The Rongai Route is more scenic than the Marangu Route and easier than other camping route in climbing Kilimanjaro and the success rate on the Rongai Route is very high. Unlike the Marangu Route where you sleep in huts, on the Rongai
              Route you sleep in tents, the porter will have your tent pitched and waiting for you at the end of each days trek. This route starts on the north side of the mountain just south of the Kenyan border and is one of the least traveled
              routes. The route merges with the Marangu Route for the summit climb. The descend follows the Marangu Route on the mountainâ€™s southeast side, so you will able see Kilimanjaro from many view points. There are two versions of this trek

            <h3>Kilimanjaro Shira Route 7 Days</h3>
            <p>
              This route approaches Kilimanjaro from the west and is nearly identical to the Lemosho Route. In fact, Shira was the original Lemosho route in this western side of the mountain. While Lemosho starts at Londorossi Gate and treks
              through
              the rain forest to Shira 1 Camp, the Shira route bypasses this segment by using a vehicle to transport climbers to Shira Gate, located near the Shira Ridge.
              On the first day on the mountain, climbers begin their hike from (3,400 m) and end at Shira One Campsite, (3,5OO m). The remainder of the route is follows the southern circuit route, traversing beneath the Southern icefields before
              summitting from Barafu or Western Breach Route.

            <h3>Kilimanjaro Umbwe Route 6 Days</h3>
            <p>
              Umbwe is a short route, providing challenges as it is very difficult to climb due to its steepness. Due to the fast ascension, this route does not provide the enough time for altitude acclimatization so proceeding slowly is vital.
              Although the traffic on this route is very low, the chances of success are not as great unless a acclimitization day is added. The route is offered at a minimum of six days, and seven days is preferred. This route merges along the way
              with Machame route, Lemosho route and Shira route.
              Western Breach Approach
              An alternative route to the summit approaches Uhuru Peak from the west, called the Western Breach Route. The strenuous Western Breach ascends 850m in about 1.25 miles (2 km), and requires some scrambling (climbing on hands and feet) at
              certain points. This path is very beautiful but also very challenging due to its rocks formations and its steep slope. The Western Breach was gaining popularity by climbers using the Umbwe, Lemosho, Shira and Machame routes until a
              rock fall claimed the lives of three climbers in January 2006. In response, Kilimanjaro National Park (KINAPA) closed the Western Breach Route but in 2007 KINAPA open it again with condition that all clients and their supporting
              members who want to use this option must sign at the entrance gate that they are doing for their own risk.
