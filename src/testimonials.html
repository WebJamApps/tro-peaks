            <p>&ldquo;Daniel&rsquo;s input into my Kilimanjaro climb was pivotal.&nbsp; His experience, wisdom and knowledge are beyond his years.
              His quiet, friendly and confident style is absolutely what we needed &ndash; Daniel is the perfect guide. Knowing he was in control meant our sole
              concern was to put one foot in front of the other. Anyone lucky enough to launch on a trek with Daniel starts off with a huge advantage and is in
              for a special experience.&rdquo; <br><strong>Marcus Beale</strong></p>

            <p>&#34;Daniel is patient, kind and extremely hard working. His fitness is unsurpassable and his ability to manage complex and often dangerous
              situations is inspiring. He helped me down the mountain after I got altitude sickness and immediately (and literally) ran up the mountain to join
              the rest of the team. He is a caring and supportive team leader and he gains the respect of his colleagues by setting an excellent example to others.
              He has deep integrity and strong personal charisma.&#34;<br> <strong>Jamie Large</strong></p>

            <p>&ldquo;Daniel led a team of six of us up Kilimanjaro two years ago. I cannot speak too highly of him. He is intelligent, personable, thoughtful,
              attentive and most important of all, extremely competent. He has a great knowledge of the environment and huge experience of the mountain and its
              climatic conditions. Over our seven day trip he became a very good and trusted friend to us all. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go with Daniel again,
              but at 69 my camping days are over...&rdquo;<br><strong> Robin</strong></p>

            <p>&quot;Daniel was a perfect guide. He is athletic, supportive, enthusiastic, professional, and very knowledgeable about the environment. He
              recently guided my multi-cultural group, including some Japanese people, and was helpful to us all. He obviously genuinely loves what he is doing
              and takes personal pride in making hikers happy. I would happily hike with him again....&quot;<br><strong>Ryan Rutledge </strong></p>

              "In December I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro with 4 friends. It was the most incredible trip of our lives because of the
              hard work of Daniel and Tro-Peaks Adventure. For 5 months we stayed in close contact with Daniel as he organized every minuet
              detail of our trip - from our transportation from Nairobi to Moshi to the incredible safari itinerary that he put together
              before our climb to the climb itself which was flawless in every way, to our transportation back to Nairobi. His staff was
              incredibly friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable and I speak on behalf of the entire group when I say KUDOS to Daniel for
              being an incredible guide!!! We were beyond happy with the way everything turned out and we highly recommend him and his
              services to anyone that is considering either a safari in Tanzania or the adventure of a lifetime on Mt. Kilimanjaro.
              GREAT WORK Daniel! We&#39;ll be back again soon!"<br> <strong>Ema Pasic</strong></p>

            <p>&#34;I heard about Tro-Peaks through a friend who had hiked with Daniel and suggested that my friends and I do the same. We were definitely
              happy with the recommendation. Daniel was incredibly helpful, from planning the trip, all the way to the summit of Kili. He was very
              knowledgeable about the mountain and made for an awesome guide. The meals were great too. He even brought us to his house after the trek to
              meet his family and have a beer. Highly recommend.&#34;<br /><strong>Alex Wallash</strong></p>

            <p>&#34;We climbed Kilimanjaro with Daniel - it was one of the best experiences of my life! We found Daniel to be
              professional, experienced and well organised. He is also very calm, controlled and patient - which is especially essential on the
              morning of the summit climb! He has a great team and made our experience on Kili a truly memorable one. He takes pride in his guide
              work and everything we needed was taken care of. He is also very knowledgeable about the region and Tanzania more broadly; we learnt a
              lot about the country and life in Africa. My girlfriend and I both successfully made it to the summit and it was truly awe-inspiring!
              I would not hesitate to recommend Daniel as an excellent guide &dash; as I have done to numerous friends in Australia.&#34;<br />
