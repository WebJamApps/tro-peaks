          <h4><strong>The Spices, Tropical Warmth</strong></h4>
          <p>The spice island of Zanzibar lies off the coast of Tanzania in the Indian Ocean. It is famous for once being the commercial centre of East Africa and
            the last place to abolish the slave trade. Today it combines ancient Islamic ruins, noble Arabic houses with miles of white sandy palm fringed beaches and
            coves. The ocean offers warm clear blue waters, idyllic islands excellent reefs for snorkeling/SCUBA, fantastic deep sea fishing, water sports and of
            course delicious fresh seafood. You can also opt to go for an early morning boat ride to swim with the dolphins. And if you thought that wasn&#39;t enough,
            visiting the Spice plantations (cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cardamom and others) or haggling over the price of wood carvings in the Central Market is great fun too. </p>
          <p style="padding:0;margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
          <h4><strong>Beaches</strong></h4>
          <p>Brilliant white beaches lapped by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean provide the perfect places to relax, soak up the busy sightseeing. Modern resorts
            nestle in the shade of coconut palms, providing cool and comfortable retreats. The beaches are paradise. Most indigenous people live in fishing villages
            where they live a simple way of life, unchanged through the years. Just south of Zanzibar town are Fuji Beach and Chuini Beach, which both offer
            facilities for a range of water sports, while to the north there is Mangapwani where the only noise is likely to be the sound of the ocean. On the
            northern tip of the Island is Nungwi, where visitors can watch fishermen&#39;s boats being built or swim in the coral lagoons. </p>
          <p>On Zanzibar&#39;s northeast coast are the beaches of Matemwe, Mapenzi, Kiwenga and Uroa, with their wide stretches of uncrowded sands and opportunities
            to explore the underwater world. Other well developed resorts areas: Pingwe, Bwejuu and Jambiani are to be found on the south-eastern coast. As well as
            water sports there are also opportunities for fishing or for observing the activities of the local fishermen. </p>
          <p style="padding:0;margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
          <h4><strong>Old Culture</strong></h4>
          <p>Tours of Zanzibar island are rewarding experience. Visitors will travel past fragrant plantation of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and other spices on their
            way to a number of places of historical interest. In the south of the island is the walled city of Kizimkazi, where the ruins of Shirazi mosque, part of
            which dates back nearly 900 years, are found. A coral stone inscription provides evidence of its age, making it one of the earliest Islamic buildings in
            this part of Africa. Head north from Zanzibar town and visitors will encounter the palace ruins of Maruhubi and Mtoni. The ruins of Maruhubi offer a
            tantalising glimpse of former grandeur of this palace built by Sultan Bargash in 1880 to house his harem, but burnt down in 1889. The palace of Mtoni
            suffered a similar fate. Dating back to the early part of 19 century, it once housed 1,000 people. These are few examples of historical ruins that
            dotted throughout the island. Others to be found at Chuini, Dunga, Kidichi, Kizimbani and Bungi. </p>
          <p style="padding:0;margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
          <h4><strong>Jozani</strong></h4>
          <p> 35 km southeast from Zanzibar City is Jozani Forest Reserve, an area of 10 sq.km whose thick forest,
            with trees over 100 years old, are one of the
            last remaining sanctuaries of red colubus monkey.</p>
          <p style="padding:0;margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
          <h4><strong>Changuu</strong></h4>
          <p> Changuu is another popular destination. The island was used to contain disobedient slaves and jail was
            built in 1893 but never used. Today the
            island's most famous inhabitants are giant tortoise and it is a popular place for a swim, a stroll
            or a picnic.</p>

          <h3>Pangani</h3>

          <p> Pangani is situated about 50km south of Tanga, at the extreme Northeastern corner of Tanzania. Several
            historical sites serve as reminders for the strong Arabic influence and the later German, British colonial period in East Africa.
            Pangani is the land of historical Swahili and Arab culture existing today. The historic town of Pangani lies along the coastline of
            the sparkling blue waters of the Indian Ocean. Coral reefs and white sand beaches are some of the natural treasures which await
            discovery but equally fascinating is the rich culture and tradition which can be experienced with local people.<br />

          <h3>Bagamoyo</h3>

          <p> Some 75 km to the north of Dar es Salaam, on the coast opposite Zanzibar, is the former capital of German
            East Africa, Bagamoyo. Possessing a good, natural harbour ideal for sailing vessels and dhows, it was once the centre of the
            notorious slave trade. Its name is derived from the word Bwagomoyo, which means &quot;Here I throw down my heart,&quot;
            reflecting the desperation and despair of the &#39;broken hearted&#39; captives whose voyage into the unknown began here. The
            present police station, near the beachfront, was the first stone building in Bagamayo. Originally an Arab residence it was at
            one time the old prison where slaves were herded through underground tunnels to waiting dhows. The city was also the starting
            point for the first European explorers on their way to search for the source of the Nile. Livingstone, Stanley, Burton and Speke
            all passed through here. Livingstone&#39;s body was laid to rest here before being taken first to Zanzibar and then to England.
            The Mission has a museum with a wonderful collection of photographs and mementoes relating to Livingstone and to German colonial
            times. A house where Henry Morton Stanley lived a century ago can be seen in solitary splendor near the beach.</p>

          <h3>Dar es Salaam</h3>

          <p>With a population of
            5 million, Dar is easily the largest city in Tanzania. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world, in fact.
            Dar es Salaam boasts one of the finest natural harbours in the world, and while it has become a bustling port and economic centre,
            it remains a place of fascination, with many reminders of its colourful past. Dhows still ply its waters. Dug-outs, filled
            with fish, bob by the harbourside. The city also displays the many influences of its history. There&#39;s an Asian district,
            with its speciality shops, tea rooms, restaurants and Hindu temples, while the German colonisation has left behind a
            Bavarian-style railway station, the Roman Catholic St. Joseph&#39;s Cathedral and the Lutheran Azania Front Church. The
            flower-filled parks &#45; like the peaceful Botanical Gardens &#45; tree-lined streets and Gymkana Club, are evidence of British
            occupation. The Nyerere Cultural Centre, a self-supporting handicraft scheme, is well worth a visit. Here over 100 young
            artists can be seen at work producing various works including paintings, carvings, batiks, pottery and weavings.</p>

          <p>Enjoy the hustle and bustle of the Kariakoo Market where fish, fruit, vegetables, traditional medicines, herbs
            and livestock are traded. The maze of stalls and shops in the bazaar that surrounds the market, are also worth exploring.</p>
          <p>We can arrange an itinerary to fit nearly every budget.</p>
